# Introduction
Sales and Inventory is one of the important departments that must be
well managed in order to ensure daily business activities run smoothly.
Keeping the sales and inventory details is very important for retailers.
Retail store sells wide range of goods and services from wholesaler or
suppliers to the end-user. Thus, the nature of retail business required a
good management of sales and inventory level in order to meet the
demand of customers.
The traditional way retailer keeps their sales and inventory details in
book i.e., bookkeeping. which are not effective anymore when the size
of the shop gets bigger. This is because more items will be made
available in a larger quantity, thus tracking the sales made with
inventory level in the shop would be complicated and time consuming
for the retailer. Besides, the situation gets worst when the retailer does
not have proper method to determine items purchased by their
customers.
Thus, this project will provide solution for retailers that are still using
traditional way in keeping their inventory Sales and Inventory
Management System is a computer-based system that provides the shop
structure for maintaining and controlling goods to be stocked. It can
help identify issues such as under-stocking items and over-stocking
items that can directly affect cash-flow. This helps the business owner
keep track of the profitability of a business.
The primary purpose of inventory management is to ensure there is
enough goods or materials to meet demand without creating overstock,
or excess inventory
